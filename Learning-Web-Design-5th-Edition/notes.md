### A WEB PAGE
in this chapter we tackle five steps that cover 
the basics of page production:
1.  __Start with content.__ 
    As a starting point, we'll write up raw text content and see what browsers do with it.
2.  __Give the document structure.__
    You'll learn about HTML, element syntax and the elements that set up areas for content and metadata.
3.  __Identify text elements.__
    You'll describe the content using the appropriate text elements and learn about the proper way to use HTML.
4.  __Add an image.__
    By adding an image to the page, you'll learn about attributes and empty elements.
5.  __Change how the text looks with a style sheet.__
    This exercise gives you a taste of formatting content with Cascading Style Sheets.

## STEP 1: START WITH CONTENT 
1.  __Type the home page content.__
